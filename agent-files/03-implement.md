# Phase 3: Implement

> **Workflow:** 1. Clarify → 2. Design → 3. **Implement**
> See [overview](00-overview.md) for details.

## Purpose

This phase executes the approved design through coordinated, autonomous work. The main agent acts as a **coordinator**, delegating high-level implementation steps to subagents who implement, test, commit, and report back.

Why delegate to subagents?
- **Clean context** — Main agent stays focused on the big picture, subagents handle implementation details
- **Smart execution** — Subagents are equally capable; they receive full design context and make decisions autonomously
- **Logical units** — Each step is a coherent piece of work with multiple commits if needed
- **Fresh perspective** — Each subagent approaches their step without accumulated mental clutter
- **Recoverable failures** — Issues are isolated to individual steps

**After completion:** Human tests the implementation, then creates PR.

## The Work

The coordinator works through these stages:

### 1. Prepare

- Read `02-design.md` and understand the implementation approach
- Review `01-requirements.md` for verification criteria
- Read relevant `CLAUDE.md` files for affected components
- Note the components to modify and testing strategy

### 2. Create Implementation Plan

Write `03-implementation.md` with a checklist of high-level steps. Each step should be a **logical unit** that a smart, autonomous subagent can execute independently.

**Step characteristics:**
- **Logical scope**: Represents a coherent piece of work
- **Tests included**: New logic includes its tests—don't create separate "write tests" steps
- **Not too detailed**: Subagents are equally capable—they don't need line-by-line instructions
- **Self-contained**: Each step leaves the app compiling and tests passing
- **Can contain multiple commits**: A step can include several related commits
- **Clear outcome**: Success is obvious (tests pass, feature works)

Include **validation steps** at strategic points—not after every step, but at natural checkpoints and always at the end. Validation steps use the running application (e.g., Playwright MCP for UI verification).

**Self-review the plan**: Would an equally capable developer understand the goal and know how to execute it? If you're specifying every file and every line, you're going too deep.

### 3. Execute Steps

For each step in the plan:

**Delegate to subagent** with:
- The step to accomplish (high-level, not detailed)
- Path to relevant files (as `02-design.md`)
- Where to record progress: the step section in `03-implementation.md`

Subagents are equally capable—they read the linked files, figure out implementation details, decide what files to change, make commits as needed, and ensure tests pass.

**Subagents document their work:** Progress, decisions, and discoveries are written directly to `03-implementation.md`. This persists the knowledge and keeps the coordinator's context lean.

**Evaluate the report** and decide next action:
- **Success** → Proceed to next step
- **Minor deviation** → Note in `03-implementation.md`, proceed if result is acceptable
- **Plan adjustment** → Update `03-implementation.md` with new approach and rationale, continue
- **Blocking issue** → Stop immediately, document blocker, report to developer (may need to return to design phase)

### 4. Final Verification

Before declaring complete:
- Run all checks: `./dev backend check`, `./dev frontend check`
- Run all tests: `./dev backend test`, `./dev frontend e2e`
- Review `01-requirements.md` — verify each requirement is addressed
- Run validation step: start application, verify key flows work
- Document verification results in `03-implementation.md`

### 5. Prepare for Human Testing

Do NOT create a PR. Instead:
- Ensure all changes are committed
- Update `03-implementation.md` with:
  - Summary of what was implemented
  - Any deviations from the design
  - Known issues or limitations
  - Instructions for testing
- Report completion to developer for manual testing

The developer will test, then create the PR when satisfied.

## The Implementation Document

Create `03-implementation.md` in the feature folder. The number of steps depends on feature size: small features may have 1-2 steps, larger features may have 5+. Each step is a logical unit.

## Verification

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Requirements verified
- [ ] Manual validation complete
```

## Completion Gate

- All implementation steps completed
- All tests pass
- Requirements verified against `01-requirements.md`
- Final validation passed
- `03-implementation.md` documents any deviations
- Branch is ready for human testing (no PR yet)

## Principles

- **Coordinator, not implementer** — Main agent orchestrates; subagents execute
- **High-level steps** — Logical units, not detailed instructions; trust subagent intelligence
- **Multiple commits per step** — Each step can include several commits; tests pass after each step
- **Clean main context** — Subagents handle details so coordinator stays focused on big picture
- **Sequential execution** — One step at a time; later steps may change based on earlier results
- **Tests with code** — Tests belong in the same step as the code they verify, not as separate steps
- **Document deviations** — Note anything different from the design
- **Stop on blockers** — Don't guess or work around fundamental issues
- **Human tests first** — No PR until developer verifies the implementation
